Only bhakti can lead the mind to the right aim. Concentration however, sustained and guided by ardent faith, is directed towards God: the state of niruddha is reached, in which manas (mind), buddhi (intellect) and ahamkāra (sense of the I) are under control and come to be completely reabsorbed in Him. Then the sense of I and you disappears, one attains the sole reality that is Śiva.",

Similarly, when one is engaged in various empirical acts there should be the firm conviction ‘I am the Self’, without allowing the false idea ‘I am the body, etc.’ to rise. If the mind should stray away from its state, then immediately one should enquire, ‘Oh! Oh! We are not the body, etc. Who are we?’ and thus one should reinstate the mind in that (pure) state. The enquiry ‘Who am I?’ is the principal means to the removal of all misery and the attainment of the supreme bliss. When in this manner the mind becomes quiescent in its own state, Self-experience arises of its own accord, without any hindrance. Thereafter sensory pleasures and pains will not affect the mind. All (phenomena) will appear then, without attachment, like a dream. Never forgetting one’s plenary Self-experience is real bhakti (devotion), yoga (mind control), jnana (knowledge) and all other austerities. Thus say the sages.",

Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).",

In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-happiness. Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it. Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. A wise man stays permanently in the shade. Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave  Brahman. The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness. In fact, what is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e., when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery.",

When the hosts of Saṃkalpas (in us) perish, then it is that the light of Chit will shine in us which is quiescent and immaculate and manifests itself as the universe.

Rising from a small beginning, this Saṃkalpa is the primeval seed. Gradually and regularly increasing, it begins to obscure the one clear Paramātma, like the thick clouds, in order to generate firmly the conception of inertness. Oh my son, when the intelligence views the visible things outside, then it differentiates them from itself. Then Saṃkalpa reigns supreme. The seed of Jñāna is no other than the sprout of Saṃkalpa. This Saṃkalpa, having considered itself as different from others, will generate itself as well as increase prodigiously. Such a procedure is for its evil only and is in no way beneficial to it. Therefore do not dream of walking in the path of Saṃkalpa. Do not for a moment contemplate upon the things of the universe. Through such a contemplation, there will ensue to you supreme happiness. You need not exert yourself too much to rid yourself of this Saṃkalpa. With the checking of all thoughts, one’s mind will perish. To crumple a full-blown flower in one’s hand, taxes a little effort, but even that little effort is not needed to do away with Saṃkalpa. Saṃkalpa is destroyed with the control of thoughts. Having firmly annihilated the external Saṃkalpa through the internal one, and having destroyed the impure mind through the pure one, may you rest firmly in your Ātma-jñāna.",

Instead of thinking with certainty as we do now we live for objects or the objects live for us; or in the absence of these invaluable objects, the ‘I’ does not exist or these objects do not exist in the absence of ‘I’, one should, through pure enquiry, differentiate himself (as separate) from the objects, with the idea the ‘I’ does not belong to the objects or the objects do not belong to the ‘I’; and his mind should give up all Vāsanās with no faltering certitude and should perform all things, as if in sport. This is what is called jñeya-Tyāga (or the renunciation of the known), Oh Rāma showering grace like clouds. Then having destroyed the Vāsanās and looking with an equal vision over all, if one should abandon this burden of the body, then such an extinction of Vāsanās constitutes the stainless jñeya-tyāga (or the renunciation of the known). Those only are the wise who have given up all the Vāsanās which have concreted themselves into the tangible shape of the body of Ahaṃkāra.",

Think of one as a good friend of yours and there the thing is created as a reality. Think of him as your foe and then also the mind perfects the thought into an actuality. Like the properties of the murderous poison or the rejuvenating nectar which accomplish their desired ends, so also if once the bondage-giving thoughts are completely destroyed by one, then they will never resurrect from their grave. How can we attribute enmity or friendship to the intelligence in diverse forms arising from the one Ātma? If we begin to enquire, as to who are in the tabernacle (of body) which is nothing but a network of bones filled with flesh, blood and skin and which, though non-existent, deludes us with its existence as real, then what remains is this ‘I’. Then contemplating still further with the mind, we find through the stainless Brahmic Vision gradually developed, that neither you nor I nor Puṇya nor Pāvana nor anyone else exists, but the one Jñāna which then shines alone.",

Whatever of intelligence we see in nature is but the reflection from this Self upon nature. Nature itself is insentient. You must remember that the word nature also includes the mind; mind is in nature; thought is in nature; from thought, down to the grossest form of matter, everything is in nature, the manifestation of nature. This nature has covered the Self of man, and when nature takes away the covering the Self becomes unveiled, and appears in Its own glory.",

So that wave represents the idea of the cow, the form or the meaning as we call it. That apparent cow that you know is really that wave in the mind-stuff, and that comes as a reaction to the internal and external sound-vibrations, and with the sound, the wave dies away; that wave can never exist without a word. You may ask how it is when we only think of the cow, and do not hear a sound. You make that sound yourself. You are saying \"cow\" faintly in your mind, and with that comes a wave. There cannot be any wave without this impulse of sound, and when it is not from outside it is from inside, and when the sound dies, the wave dies. What remains? The result of the reaction, and that is knowledge. These three are so closely combined in our mind that we cannot separate them. When the sound comes, the senses vibrate, and the wave rises in reaction; they follow so closely upon one another that there is no discerning one from the other; when this meditation has been practiced for a long time, memory, the receptacle of all impressions, becomes purified, and we are able clearly to distinguish them from one another. This is called \"Nirvitarka,\" concentration without reasoning.",

That through which it expresses itself is called the body.  You are everywhere.  When one body or machine fails you, the centre moves on and takes up other particles of matter, finer or grosser, and works through them.  Here is man, and what is God?  God is a circle, with circumference nowhere, and centre everywhere.  Every point in that circle is living.  conscious, active, and equally working.  With our limited souls, only one point is conscious, and that point moves forward and backward.",
